# Readme  

This repository contains the the code and background information/references for creating a next word prediction, __Shiny__ application in `R`.  

The primary objective is to test various forms of a __Neaural Network__ to accomplish this. As a last resort the `n-grams` package will be used.

## Methadology  

### Option 1: Feed-forward Neural Network  

The Feed-forward Neural Network will leverage Octave/MatLab code from my Neural Network programming assignment from the [Neural Networks for Machine Learning Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets) course.  

#### Option 1a: R.matlab  

The first task is to leverage the `R.matlab` package (and potentially the `darch` package) to execute the code in `R`.  

#### Option 1b: Manual Porting  

should the above task prove unsuccessfule, the second task will to manually port the MatLab/Octave code by rewriting the various functions in `R`.  

#### Option 1c: SRA  

Depending on the success and optimization results of the above tasks, this task will involve leveraging the 

### Option 2: Dual-Path  

### Option 3: N-grams
